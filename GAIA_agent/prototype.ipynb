      "Question: Hi, I'm making a pie but I could use some help with my shopping list. I have everything I need for the crust, but I'm not sure about the filling. I got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker on my phone is buzzing so I can't quite make out what she's saying. Could you please listen to the recipe and list all of the ingredients that my friend described? I only want the ingredients for the filling, as I have everything I need to make my favorite pie crust. I've attached the recipe as Strawberry pie.mp3.\n",

      "{'title': 'Hunter × Hunter', 'summary': 'Hunter × Hunter (pronounced \"hunter hunter\") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha\\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 38 tankōbon volumes as of September 2024. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\\nHunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.\\nThe manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim\\'s Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\\nHunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter'}\n",

This paper investigates scenarios\\ninvolving the autonomous collaboration of future LM agents. We review the\\ncurrent state of LM agents, the key technologies enabling LM agent\\ncollaboration, and the security and privacy challenges they face during\\ncooperative operations. To this end, we first explore the foundational\\nprinciples of LM agents, including their general architecture, key components,\\nenabling technologies, and modern applications. We then discuss practical\\ncollaboration paradigms from data, computation, and knowledge perspectives to\\nachieve connected intelligence among LM agents. After that, we analyze the\\nsecurity vulnerabilities and privacy risks associated with LM agents,\\nparticularly in multi-agent settings, examining underlying mechanisms and\\nreviewing current and potential countermeasures. Lastly, we propose future\\nresearch directions for building robust and secure LM agent ecosystems.'}\n"

      "{\"wiki_results\": \"<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who is the 47th president of the United States. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\\nBorn into a wealthy family in the New York City borough of Queens, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became the president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization, and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He launched side ventures, many licensing the Trump name, and filed for six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice, bolstering his fame as a billionaire. Presenting himself as a political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton.\\nDuring his first presidency, Trump imposed a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, expanded the Mexico–United States border wall, and enforced a family separation policy on the border. He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program, and initiated a trade war with China. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020, he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the CARES Act. After losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Trump attempted to overturn the result, culminating in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times. \\nIn 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases for sexual abuse and defamation and for business fraud. He was found guilty of falsifying business records in 2024, making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony. After winning the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris, he was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge, and two felony indictments against him for rentention of classified documents and obstruction of the 2020 election were dismissed without prejudice. A racketeering case related to the 2020 election in Georgia is pending.\\nTrump began his second presidency by pardoning around 1,500 January 6 rioters and initiating mass layoffs of federal workers. He imposed tariffs on nearly all countries, including large tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. Many of his administration's actions, including intimidation of political opponents and civil society, deportations of immigrants, and extensive use of executive orders, have drawn over 300 lawsuits challenging their legality. High-profile cases have underscored his broad interpretation of the unitary executive theory and have led to significant conflicts with the federal courts.\\nTrump is the central figure of Trumpism, and his faction is dominant within the Republican Party. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racist or misogynistic,  and he has made false and misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Trump's actions, especially in his second term, have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. He is of German and Scottish descent. He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert, in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. Fred Trump paid his c\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nDonald John Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977), often nicknamed Don Jr., is an American businessman and political activist. He is the eldest child of U.S. president Donald Trump and his first wife Ivana.\\nTrump serves as a trustee and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, running the company alongside his younger brother Eric. During their father's first presidency, the brothers continued to engage in deals and investments in foreign countries and collect payments at their U.S. properties from foreign governments, despite pledging not to do so. He also served as a boardroom judge on the reality TV show featuring his father, The Apprentice. In addition, he authored Triggered in 2019 and Liberal Privilege in 2020.\\nTrump was active in his father's 2016 presidential campaign. He had a meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Trump campaigned for several Republicans during the 2018 midterm elections. He has promoted several conspiracy theories.\\nTrump was also active in his father's 2020 presidential campaign, often being on the campaign trail and being featured in the news for making unfounded claims. During the election he called for \\\"total war\\\" as the results were counted and promoted the stolen election conspiracy theory. Following his father's defeat, he engaged in attempts to overturn the results. He spoke at the rally that led to the storming of the Capitol, where he threatened Trump's opponents that \\\"we're coming for you.\\\" In January 2021, Attorney General for the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that he is looking at whether to charge Donald Trump Jr. with inciting the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol in the criminal investigation into the attack. CNN reported in April 2022 that two days after the election, Trump Jr. sent a text message to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows outlining paths to subvert the Electoral College process and ensure his father a second term.\\nAt the 2024 Republican National Convention, he led the introductions of JD Vance, who had been selected as Donald Trump's running mate.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nTrump was born on December 31, 1977, in Manhattan, New York City, to Ivana and Donald Trump. He has two younger siblings, Ivanka and Eric. He also has two half siblings, Tiffany, from his father's marriage to Marla Maples, and Barron, from his father's current marriage to Melania Trump. Through his father, Trump is a grandson of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod, and a great-grandson of Frederick Trump and Elizabeth Christ Trump, the latter of whom founded what became the Trump Organization. As a boy, Trump found a role model in his maternal grandfather, Miloš Zelníček, who had a home near Prague, where he spent summers camping, fishing, hunting and learning the Czech language.\\nHis parents divorced when he was 12 years old due to his father having an extramarital affair. Trump Jr. was estranged from his father for one year after the divorce, furious at his actions which broke up the family.\\nTrump was educated at Buckley School and The Hill School, a college preparatory boarding school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, followed by the University of Pennsylvania's (Penn) Wharton School, where he graduated in 2000 with a B.S. in Economics.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nAfter graduating from Penn in 2000, Trump moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, skied, lived in a truck, and worked as a bartender for a year, before returning to join the Trump Organization in New York. Trump has supervised building projects, which included 40 Wall Street, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Park Avenue, In 2006 he helped launch Trump Mortgage, which collapsed less than a year later. In 2010, he became a spokesperson and \\\"executive director of global branding\\\" for Cambridge Who's Who, a vanity publisher against whom hundreds of complaints had already been filed with the Better Business Bureau.

Traditional agents face significant limitations,\\nincluding substantial data requirements and difficulty in generalizing to new\\nenvironments. LLM-based agents address these challenges by leveraging LLMs as\\ntheir core reasoning engine. These agents achieve superior QA results compared\\nto traditional QA pipelines and naive LLM QA systems by enabling interaction\\nwith external environments. We systematically review the design of LLM agents\\nin the context of QA tasks, organizing our discussion across key stages:\\nplanning, question understanding, information retrieval, and answer generation.\\nAdditionally, this paper identifies ongoing challenges and explores future\\nresearch directions to enhance the performance of LLM agent QA systems.\\\"\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document title =\\\"Can LLMs Understand Social Norms in Autonomous Driving Games?\\\" authors =\\\"Boxuan Wang, Haonan Duan, Yanhao Feng, Xu Chen, Yongjie Fu, Zhaobin Mo, Xuan Di\\\"/>\\n summary =\\\"Social norm is defined as a shared standard of acceptable behavior in a\\nsociety. The emergence of social norms fosters coordination among agents\\nwithout any hard-coded rules, which is crucial for the large-scale deployment\\nof AVs in an intelligent transportation system. This paper explores the\\napplication of LLMs in understanding and modeling social norms in autonomous\\ndriving games. We introduce LLMs into autonomous driving games as intelligent\\nagents who make decisions according to text prompts. These agents are referred\\nto as LLM-based agents. Our framework involves LLM-based agents playing Markov\\ngames in a multi-agent system (MAS), allowing us to investigate the emergence\\nof social norms among individual agents. We aim to identify social norms by\\ndesigning prompts and utilizing LLMs on textual information related to the\\nenvironment setup and the observations of LLM-based agents. Using the OpenAI\\nChat API powered by GPT-4.0, we conduct experiments to simulate interactions\\nand evaluate the performance of LLM-based agents in two driving scenarios:\\nunsignalized intersection and highway platoon. The results show that LLM-based\\nagents can handle dynamically changing environments in Markov games, and social\\nnorms evolve among LLM-based agents in both scenarios. In the intersection\\ngame, LLM-based agents tend to adopt a conservative driving policy when facing\\na potential car crash. The advantage of LLM-based agents in games lies in their\\nstrong operability and analyzability, which facilitate experimental design.\\\"\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document title =\\\"LLM Agent Honeypot: Monitoring AI Hacking Agents in the Wild\\\" authors =\\\"Reworr, Dmitrii Volkov\\\"/>\\n summary =\\\"Attacks powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a growing\\nthreat to modern cybersecurity.

Over a trial deployment of about three months in a public\\nenvironment, we collected 8,130,731 hacking attempts and 8 potential AI agents.\\nOur work demonstrates the emergence of AI-driven threats and their current\\nlevel of usage, serving as an early warning of malicious LLM agents in the\\nwild.\\\"\\n</Document>\"}\n",
